## Problem 2

  - **Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset
    should include all originally observed variables and values; have
    useful variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and
    encode data with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting
    dataset (e.g. what variables exist, how many observations, etc).**

<!-- end list -->

``` r
activity_df = read.csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  pivot_longer(activity.1:activity.1440,
               names_to = "minute_of_day",
               names_prefix = "activity.",
               values_to = "activity_count"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday_or_weekend = ifelse(day == "Saturday" | day == "Sunday", "weekend", "weekday"),
    minute_of_day = as.integer(minute_of_day)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    day = factor(day, levels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
  )
```

The accelerometer data taken from a 63 yr-old male with BMI of 25, with
50400 observations and 6 variables, contains the following variables:

  - **week**: integer type designating which week the data was recorded
    from week 1 to week 5

  - **day\_id**: integer type designating which day of the 5 week period
    the data was recorded from day 1 to day 35

  - **day**: factor type designating the day of the week to the
    corresponding data

  - **minute\_of\_day**: integer type designating the minute of the day
    starting at midnight from minute 1 to minute 1440

  - **activity\_count**: numeric type that measures accelerometer data
    that can be translated into physcial activity levels.

  - **weekday\_or\_weekend**: character type that says if the
    corresponding data was taken on a weekday or weekend

  - **Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total
    activity over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross
    minutes to create a total activity variable for each day, and create
    a table showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?**

<!-- end list -->

``` r
activity_df %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  summarize(total_activity = sum(activity_count)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "day",
    values_from = "total_activity"
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 0)
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'week' (override with `.groups` argument)

| week | Sunday | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday |
| ---: | -----: | -----: | ------: | --------: | -------: | -----: | -------: |
|    1 | 631105 |  78828 |  307094 |    340115 |   355924 | 480543 |   376254 |
|    2 | 422018 | 295431 |  423245 |    440962 |   474048 | 568839 |   607175 |
|    3 | 467052 | 685910 |  381507 |    468869 |   371230 | 467420 |   382928 |
|    4 | 260617 | 409450 |  319568 |    434460 |   340291 | 154049 |     1440 |
|    5 | 138421 | 389080 |  367824 |    445366 |   549658 | 620860 |     1440 |

It is hard to detect any trends in the table without more exploratory
analysis.

  - **Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course
    of the day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity
    time courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week.
    Describe in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on
    this graph.**

<!-- end list -->

``` r
activity_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = minute_of_day, y = activity_count, color = day)) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "24Hr Activity Plot Over 5 Weeks",
    x = "Minute of the Day (min)", 
    y = "Activity Count (arbitrary unit)",
    caption = "Accelerometer data of a 63yr old male with BMI of 25 over 5 weeks"
  )
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

![](p8105_hw3_jak2312_files/figure-gfm/plot_activity-1.png)<!-- -->

There were too many points to plot for a scatterplot to be interpreted.
I opted to only keep a smoothed version as it will average the activity
counts over the weeks for each day and present a more aesthetic graph.

From the plot we can see that at the start of the day we see very low
activity, assuming that is this particular person sleeping. At around 6
am this person seems to wake up and start their day, indicated by the
rise in activity level at around the 250-300 minute mark. This person
then remains awake/active steadily throughout the week from minute 375
to 1250. This person seems to be less active during Saturdays compared
to the rest of the week. This person also seems to be more active in the
later half of the day with the exception of Sunday.

## Problem 3

``` r
data("ny_noaa")
```

This dataset contains 2595176 rows and 7 columns.

Observations made in this dataset are from NY based weather stations.
The following variables are included in this dataset:

  - **id**: There are 747 distinct weather stations reporting data

  - **date**: The dates corresponding to the reported weather data are
    from 1981-01-01 – 2010-12-31

  - **prcp**: Precipitation data reported in tenths of mm are reported.
    Indicates how much rain on a given day (\# NAs: 145838)

  - **snow**: Snowfall data reported in mm. Indicates how much snow has
    fallen on a given day (\# NAs: 381221)

  - **snwd**: Snow depth data reported in mm. Indicates the max depth of
    snow on the ground on a given day (\# NAs: 591786)

  - **tmax**: Maximum temperature on a given day reported in tenths of
    °C. (\# NAs: 1134358)

  - **tmin**: Minimum temperature on a given day reported in tenths of
    °C. (\# NAs: 1134420)

The number of NA’s in this dataset is concerning, especially if we want
to do an analysis over the total period of time. However, for certain
variables it is less significant than others. We can assume that for the
days that the observations report NA values for prcp, snow, and snwd
that it did not rain nor snow on those days. However, if we want to do
an analysis of min and max temperature variations over the whole time
period, we cannot feasibly accomplish this due to the missing values.

  - **Do some data cleaning. Create separate variables for year, month,
    and day. Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and
    snowfall are given in reasonable units. For snowfall, what are the
    most commonly observed values? Why?**

<!-- end list -->

``` r
ny_noaa_df = ny_noaa %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>% 
  mutate(
    tmax = as.integer(tmax),
    tmin = as.integer(tmin)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    prcp = prcp / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10,
    tmin = tmin / 10
  )

ny_noaa_df %>% 
  count(snow) %>%
  drop_na() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 281 x 2
    ##     snow       n
    ##    <int>   <int>
    ##  1     0 2008508
    ##  2    25   31022
    ##  3    13   23095
    ##  4    51   18274
    ##  5    76   10173
    ##  6     8    9962
    ##  7     5    9748
    ##  8    38    9197
    ##  9     3    8790
    ## 10   102    6552
    ## # … with 271 more rows

0mm is the most commonly reported value for snowfall, which makes sense
as it only snows during the winter, and even then it is unlikely to snow
during the winter. The following most common snowfall amounts range from
\~ 5 - 100mm which is not much snowfall, probably what you would expect
on a given day when it actually snows.

  - **Make a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in
    January and in July in each station across years. Is there any
    observable / interpretable structure? Any outliers?**

<!-- end list -->

``` r
ny_noaa_df %>% 
  filter(month %in% c("01", "07")) %>% 
  group_by(id, month,year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_tmax, group = id)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .1) + 
  geom_path(alpha = .3) +
  facet_grid(. ~ month) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'id', 'month' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## Warning: Removed 5970 rows containing missing values (geom_point).

    ## Warning: Removed 5640 row(s) containing missing values (geom_path).

It is tough to see with so many points and lines overlapping each other,
but it is clear that all the weather stations in NY report similar
temperature ranges between each other with the exception of some
outliers. We can interpret from the plot that January is colder than
July and that the temperature ranges from \~ -10°C to 10°C and 20°C to
35°C respectively.

  - **Make a two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full
    dataset (note that a scatterplot may not be the best option); and
    (ii) make a plot showing the distribution of snowfall values greater
    than 0 and less than 100 separately by year.**
